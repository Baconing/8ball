# 8 Ball


I was bored and didn't have anything to do, so I made this with like no Java knowledge.
Only used JavaDocs and a little bit of stack overflow for things that just are weirdly complicated (like the amount of functions to repaint Components).

## Building


So yeah, prebuild binaries in releases.


```
./gradlew build
```


Jars in `app/build/libs`.
